# QuickStart_LWJGL_JOML
A QuickStart Maven development environment for LWJGL and JOML

This should be a quick hassle free plug-and-play experience. All you have to do is import this repository as a Maven Project in your IDE of choice and run the shit out of it.

* Mac users must add -XstartOnFirstThread as one of the VM arguments (usually in the run configurations options)

Thanks to @[ViniGodoy](https://github.com/ViniGodoy) for providing the OpenGL Hello World source.

Enjoy!
